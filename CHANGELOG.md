# ELECTRA Changelog
===================
Record of changes for ELECTRA project.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
ELECTRA uses a vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning scheme. The
* MAJOR version is increased when functionality that is not backwards compatible is added, the
* MINOR version is increased when backwards compatible functionality is added, and the
* PATCH version is increased when bug fixes are added.

## Version History

* v0.4.5
* v0.4.4
* v0.4.3
* v0.4.2
* v0.4.1

## 2022-02-20: v0.5.2
---------------------
### Fixed
* Corrected diffusion transition nodes of conduction system. Transition branches were 10 nodes long before. Now they are 10 nodes long except if a bifurcation is
  found. In this case the last transition node is the one located at the bifurcation.



## 2022-02-07: v0.5.1
---------------------
### Fixed
* Corrected an issue with the determination of fiber direction unit vectors. Now Electra normalizes the given fiber direction vectors internally


## 2022-01-02: v0.5.0
---------------------
### Added
* New applications: ElectraSim and ElectraPre

### Added
* Old application: ELECTRA-console

### Changed
* Json script interface. Check tutorial and examples folders for more info


## 2021-03-04: v0.4.5
---------------------
### Added
* Maleckar2009 electrophysiology model (Mathematical simulations of ligand-gated and cell-type specific effects on the action potential of human atrium, Maleckar et al. 2008, Progress in biophysics and molecular biology)

### Changed
* Included modifications on the IKCa current of the Courtemanche1998 model according to Engel and Pe√±aranda provided by Chiara Celotto

### Fixed
* Improved integration of gate variable equations in Courtemanche1998 model
* Improved integration of gate variable equations in Bueno2008 model
* Improved integration of gate variable equations in Stewart2009 model

### Changed
* Objects *ap models* and *ap type* in input script (.json) are renamed to *ep models* and *ep type*
* electrophysiology model *Ohara* is renamed to *Ohara2011m*
* electrophysiology model *Bueno* is renamed to *Bueno2008*
